// Naming Convention:
// ● Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
// ● A variable name must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
// ● Variable names are case-sensitive.
// ● It is recommended to avoid using reserved keywords as variable names such as var, let, const, function, return, etc.

/* Rules and Naming Conventions*/

// here we learn about some rules:
// => 1 = case sensitive:
let year = 2000;
let Year = 2030;
// => 2 = contains letters(Alhphabets),numbers(digits),underScore(_),Dollar-Sign($);
let name = 'harish';
let first_name = 'harish';
let amt$ = 20.5;
let num1 = 10;
// most commonly used naming conventions:
// -> first is camel-casing:This means starting with a lowercase letter and capitalising the first letter of each subsequent word. For example, firstName, totalSales,employeeSalary:
// -> second is snake-casing:When writing in "snake case," the initial letter of each word is written in lowercase, and each space is substituted with the underscore (_) character. For example: first_child_age.
// IMP = we mostly use camel-casing:
let firstChildAge = 10;
// here we have example of (snake-casing):
let first_child_age = 10;

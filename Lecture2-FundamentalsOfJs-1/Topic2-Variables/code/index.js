// IMP = Variables in JS are dynamically typed, i.e., The variables do not have any type, but the values have type, and we can reassign values to them at runtime.
// IMP = there are three way to declare variables in the javascripts:
// first is (let):
// second is (const):
// third is (var):

// => Declare and Initializing the variables:
// IMP = here we are creating the variable with the help of (let) keyword:
// -> here we (declare) the variable:
let message;
// after creating the variable: know we can provide or assign the (value) to it:
// -> here we (initialize)  that variable:
message = 'hello';
// V.IMP =  we can also create the multiple variables in (one-line):and also provide the (values) to them:
let y,x,a,b,d=30,h=20;
y = 60;
// IMP = we can also directly provide value to the (variable) after creating it:
let age = 10;
console.log(age);
// here we are changing the value of same(age) variable from (number) to (string):
// because we know that the Variables in JS are dynamically typed, the variables do not have any type, but the values have type, in javascript.and we can reassign values to them at runtime.
age = "ten";
console.log(age);

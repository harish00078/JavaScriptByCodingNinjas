// Statement:
// -> Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
// -> We’ve already seen a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.
// -> We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.
console.log("hey everyone");console.log("hello world");
// Semicolon:
// -> A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.
console.log("hey")
console.log("hello")

// IMP = In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!:
// IMP = There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon.

// => 1 = first we have:here is (MAX_VALUE):
console.log(Number.MAX_VALUE);
// => 2 = second we have:here is (MIN_VALUE):
console.log(Number.MIN_VALUE);
// IMP-NOTE = these both are not the maximum and minimum values we can have in the javascript:
// In js we also have (+Infinity) and (-Infinity):
// => 1 = first we have:here is (+Infinity):
console.log(Number.MAX_VALUE *10);
// => 2 = second we have:here is (-Infinity):
console.log(Number.MIN_VALUE * 10);
// IMP = here we are using the (Infinity) values:     
// if any thing divided with the (zero):then it will gave us the result in (infinite) or (+Infinite):
console.log(12/0);
// if any thing gets divided with the (Infinity) direclty:then it will gave us the result in (zero):
console.log(188/Infinity);

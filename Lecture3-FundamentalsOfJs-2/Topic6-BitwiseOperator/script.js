/**
 * Bitwise Operators in JavaScript
 *
 * Bitwise operators perform operations at the binary level, working with 32-bit numbers.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * - Operate on 32-bit signed integers
 * - Work with binary representations of numbers
 * -V.IMP: Convert decimal numbers to 32-bit binary internally
 * - Return results back to decimal format
 *
 * Bit Representation:
 * - 0 represents false
 * - 1 represents true
 *
 * Available Operators:
 * - & (AND)
 * - | (OR)
 * - ^ (XOR)
 * - ~ (NOT)
 * - << (Left Shift)
 * - >> (Right Shift)
 * - >>> (Unsigned Right Shift)

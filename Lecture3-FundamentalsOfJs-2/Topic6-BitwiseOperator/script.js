// Learning about Bitwise-Operators:
// Bitwise-Operators:Bitwise operators in JavaScript work at the binary-level:
// -> they operate on 32-bit numbers in their binary form. 
// V.IMP: These operators perform bitwise operations on (integer-values).
// IMP:(32-bit) means:Bitwise operators in JavaScript work on 32-bit signed integers. Even if you provide a decimal-number, JavaScript internally converts it into a 32-bit binary representation, performs the bitwise operation, and then converts it back to a decimal number.
// -> Bitwise-Operators works with the (bits) or we can say with the (binary-number):where as with in Bitwise-operators (0) represents there self as (false) and (1) represents the (true):

// here we have some bitwise operators:(&,|,^,~,<<,>>,>>> ):

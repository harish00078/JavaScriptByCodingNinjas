// V.IMP = comparison-operators basically return us the boolean-values:These operators compare two values and return a boolean value (true or false) to us  based on there comparison-result:

// V.IMP = the two of these comparison operators:you will only be find in the javascript language(===,!==):
// -> (===) = strict-equality(comparison)-operator:
// -> (!==) = strict-inequality(comparison)-operator:

// => here gonna check them one by one:
// => 1 = (==): Its known as (equality) operator:It compares the values of two operands for equality but without any type conversion. It returns true if the values are equal and have the same type or same (data-type):
console.log(5 == 5);
// => 2 = (!=):  Its known as (inequality) operator:It compares the values of two operands for inequality but without any type conversion. It returns true if the values are not equal and have the same type or same (data-type):
console.log(5 != 6);
// => 3 = (<): Its known as (less-than) operator:It compares the values of two operands and returns true if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand:
console.log(5 < 6);
// => 4 = (>): Its known as (greater-than) operator:It compares the values of two operands and returns true if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand:
console.log(6 > 5);
// => 5 = (<=): Its known as (less-than-equal-to) operator:It compares the values of two operands and returns true if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand:
console.log(5 <= 5);
//  => 6 = (>=): Its known as (greater-than-equal-to) operator:It compares the values of two operands and returns true if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand:
console.log(5 >= 5);

// => 1 = Logical-Operator:(&&,||,!):these operators perform logical operations on mulitple boolean values at once and return another boolean value as a result to us:after checking all the multiple boolean values:
// IMP = In more simpler way:when we have to (check) and (compare) more then one (boolean-values) and (condition-values) or(statements-values) which gave us the result in the form of (boolean-value):then we use the (Logical-Operators) in the javascript:
// V.IMP = but the more important is that we can also use the (non-boolean) values.which are the (truthy) and (false) values with in the (logical-operators):

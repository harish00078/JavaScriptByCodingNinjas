// => 1 = Logical-Operator:(&&,||,!):these operators perform logical operations on mulitple boolean values at once and return the another boolean value as a result to us:after checking and comparing all the multiple boolean values:
// IMP = In more simpler way:when we have to (check) and (compare) more then one (boolean-values) and (conditions) or(statements) which gave us the result in the form of (boolean-value):then we use the (Logical-Operators) in the javascript:
// V.IMP = but the more important is that we can also use the (non-boolean) values.which are the (truthy) and (false) values with in the (logical-operators):
// -> Truthy-values:non-empty strings, non-zero numbers, and objects:
// -> Falsy-values:false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and "" (empty string):
// V.IMP-(NOTE): with boolean-value's (conditions) and (statements) logical-operators work differenlty as if we compare it to the truthy,falsy (conditions) and (statements) values:

// Some of the Logical-Operators are:mainly there we have three types of Logical-Operators:(&&,||,!);
// -> first = (&&)-Logical (AND) operator:
// -> second = (||)-Logical (OR) operator:
// -> third = (!)-Logical (NOT) operator:

// -> 1 =  (&&)-Logical (AND) operator:It is used to check and compare two (boolean) values:if both of them are (true) then it will return us the (true) value as result: otherwise it will return us the (false) value as result:
// -> 2 = (||)-Logical (OR) operator:It is used to check and compare two (boolean) values:if one of them is (true) then it will return us the (true) value as result: otherwise it will return us the (false) value as result:
// -> 3 = (!)-Logical (NOT) operator:It is used to check and compare one (boolean) value:if it is (true) then it will return us the (false) value as result: otherwise it will return us the (true) value as result:

console.log("Learning More About Logical Operator");
// => (second) = here we gonna be learn about using logical operator with the non-boolean-values or we can say with the (truthy) and (falsy) values:
// V.IMP-NOTE:truthy and falsy values can  also be called as primitive and non-primitive values:and it only happens or works in the js:
// -> Truthy-values:true,non-empty strings, non-zero numbers, and objects:
// -> Falsy-values:false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and "" (empty string):

// => V.IMP-NOTE:We are able to use logical operator with the (truthy) and (falsy) values: because every-value in nodejs lies under the category of (truthy) and (falsy) values:It only happens in the js:
// -> As per there name-says that:
// Truthy-value -> Means (true):
// Falsy-value -> Means (false):

// => V.IMP-NOTE:but the more important thing is that:which we have to learn here is that:if we use logical operator with the (truthy) and (falsy) values:then how the logic behind it is working that we are getting the result in the form of (truthy) and (falsy) values as well not in (boolean-values):
// We have to Learn that how we are able to define that which value is gonna be our result:
